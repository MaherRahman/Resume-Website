# Resume-Website
Learning HTML, CSS, Javascript to create the front end of my website

Will create the backend later. This is mostly for practice, and isn't intended for any practical purposes. 
If any of my code seems useful to you, please feel free to use it, I'm essentially going to play around and see
What works, and what doesnt, and to see if I can make anything cool!
