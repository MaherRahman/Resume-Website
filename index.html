              <h2>UT Computer Science/Neuroscience honors</h2>
              <p> As a recent admit into Computer Science, I'm focusing on learning new programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end, as well as other languages such as Kotlin, Java, Python to further compliment my programming interests. I really enjoy studying the visual system in the human brain, and I hope to use my knowledge of programming to possibly advance current Computer Vision models, as well as possibly make a more functional visual model of the brain. </p>
